    "status_reasoning": "Reviewers requested clearer and fairer comparisons with alternative methods, asking to 'clarify the comparison with alternative clustering approaches... including how it differs... in the identification of genes that are part of cell activity programs.' They also noted it is 'unfair to compare with other unsupervised methods (such as PCA) if the K cannot be automatically selected.' Consequently, simulation-based accuracy/superiority claims for cNMF over other methods require additional justification and are uncertain as presented."

    "status_reasoning": "The reviewers emphasized that 'the selection parameter K is non-trivial' and found the current choices 'not convincing,' citing figures where k=13 may be preferable to k=14 and that it is 'not clear which k should be chosen.' They requested showing GEPs under different K and suggested proposing an automatic solution, so claims about K-selection guidance and robustness remain uncertain pending further evidence."

They highlighted many insufficiently justified parameters (e.g., uniform cell-type proportions in simulations, scaling non-log data, nearest-neighbor choice for outlier filtering, using 14 PCs for Louvain), rendering methodological clarity and parameter choices uncertain for reproducibility."

They further requested testing on datasets with moderate batch effects and other tissues, and to show variance explained, leaving claims about robustness across replicates/donors and batch-effect handling insufficiently supported."

As the reviewers did not challenge these application findings, they are treated as supported."
