These convergent quantitative benchmarks support the result."

It quantified activity usage across cell types (C43\u2013C47) and refined proliferative precursor composition (C45\u2013C46). These analyses substantiate that cNMF disentangles activity from identity and refines cell-type annotations (C6)."

Layer-specific induction patterns for LRPs (C50) and replication of the superficial LRP in an independent dataset with strong concordance and expected layer usage (C51) provide orthogonal support. Together these data support robust identification of stimulus-responsive activity programs."

A third program shows MEG3 and injury-associated genes (C55). While functional labels are partly speculative (C55), the existence and gene/GO composition of these programs are well supported."

In pancreatic islets, cNMF recovered major cell types but revealed donor-associated hybrid GEPs with sex-linked genes indicating batch/confounder effects and motivating batch correction (C85\u2013C87). These findings support reproducibility within experiments and highlight sensitivity to between-sample effects."
