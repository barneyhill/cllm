Software, parameters, and components (ABySS, Jellyfish, Eigenstrat modifications) are specified and released (C75\u2013C76, C79\u2013C84), supporting that the method exists and is executable.

Numerous associated sequences do not map to the human reference and include BLAST matches to non-reference human sequences or EBV contamination (C112\u2013C114, C116\u2013C118, C153\u2013C155), supporting detection outside the reference genome (C3). These observations collectively substantiate the claim across multiple analyses."

Incorporating PCs and other covariates in logistic models removes k-mer signals as expected under perfect separation, demonstrating adjustment capability and confounder assessment (C53, C68\u2013C70, C136\u2013C137). Simulations further show detectability of associations under confounding control, supporting feasibility (C138), thus validating inference and correction (C4, C49)."

The QQ and Manhattan plot interpretations are consistent with true signal enrichment around blaTEM-1 (C146), and a conventional mapping/variant-calling pipeline failed to detect genome-wide significant hits (C149). This strongly validates the approach on a known resistance phenotype (C5, C50)."

They also observe Poisson-vs-NB p-values are comparable for typical k-mers (C61). Together these support the stated power advantage of using k-mer counts (C37, C151), though the evidence is primarily simulation-based."

Prior literature contextualizes disease relevance for these SNPs (C126\u2013C129).
