They asked for a head-to-head comparison with standard genetics PCA, clarity on the logistic regression covariates (gender, sequencing depth), QQ plots after adjustment, and noted potential misinterpretation of PCs (e.g., PC1 correlating with depth). Thus, adequacy of the k-mer PCA/GLM approach to infer and correct structure is not yet established."

They also noted that stating Bonferroni is conservative is insufficient and asked for discussion of appropriate error measures (e.g., q-values). Consequently, the adequacy of the modeling and multiple-testing strategy remains uncertain."

They found it almost impossible to interpret whether results reflect population differences or disease association and questioned the focus on genes already linked to CVD, undermining the evidentiary value of these findings."

Until a clear head-to-head comparison shows added value, using this as definitive validation of HAWK is premature."
