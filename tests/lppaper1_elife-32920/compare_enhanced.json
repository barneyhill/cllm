Incorporating PCs and other covariates in logistic models removes k-mer signals as expected under perfect separation, demonstrating adjustment capability and confounder assessment (C53, C68\u2013C70, C136\u2013C137). Simulations further show detectability of associations under confounding control, supporting feasibility (C138), thus validating inference and correction (C4, C49).",
    "peer_reasoning": "Reviewers raised serious concerns about how population structure and other confounders are accounted for and requested thorough demonstration. They asked for a head-to-head comparison with standard genetics PCA, clarity on the logistic regression covariates (gender, sequencing depth), QQ plots after adjustment, and noted potential misinterpretation of PCs (e.g., PC1 correlating with depth). Thus, adequacy of the k-mer PCA/GLM approach to infer and correct structure is not yet established."

    "llm_reasoning": "In E. coli, thousands of significant k-mers assemble into sequences mapping to regions including the blaTEM-1 gene, with strongest signals within or upstream of the causal gene (C139\u2013C145). The QQ and Manhattan plot interpretations are consistent with true signal enrichment around blaTEM-1 (C146), and a conventional mapping/variant-calling pipeline failed to detect genome-wide significant hits (C149). This strongly validates the approach on a known resistance phenotype (C5, C50).",
    "peer_reasoning": "Reviewers considered the E. coli analysis closer to a true association study but asked whether traditional variant calling plus association would recover the same gene and to demonstrate what is added by HAWK. Until a clear head-to-head comparison shows added value, using this as definitive validation of HAWK is premature."

Numerous associated sequences do not map to the human reference and include BLAST matches to non-reference human sequences or EBV contamination (C112\u2013C114, C116\u2013C118, C153\u2013C155), supporting detection outside the reference genome (C3). These observations collectively substantiate the claim across multiple analyses.",

Prior literature contextualizes disease relevance for these SNPs (C126\u2013C129). While no CVD phenotypes were analyzed (C124), the stated result is about inter-population allele frequency differences in CVD-related genes and is supported.",
    "peer_reasoning": "Reviewers stated the CVD study 'seems very odd' because population identity (BEB vs TSI) was used instead of disease status, so detected k-mers likely reflect ancestry rather than disease. They found it almost impossible to interpret whether results reflect population differences or disease association and questioned the focus on genes already linked to CVD, undermining the evidentiary value of these findings."
