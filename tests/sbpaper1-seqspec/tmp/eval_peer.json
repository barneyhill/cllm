Reviewer 1 calls the approach \u201cof high value\u201d for harmonizing protocol-specific regions and notes the manuscript illustrates the diversity of read structures and the need for harmonization; Reviewer 2 deems the project timely given the growth of new protocols. No reviewer contests the claims about current custom tooling, divergent parameters, or format limitations hindering reuse."
