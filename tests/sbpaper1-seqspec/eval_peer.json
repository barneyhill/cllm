Reviewer 2 raises a substantive concern about extensibility, asking 'How are the specification files versioned? How will backwards compatibility be handled?' when new protocols require unsupported features. This indicates uncertainty about whether seqspec's flexibility will truly accommodate all future needs (C72, C73, C75, C76). The question about versioning also relates to the hope that seqspec will be adopted in public archives (C87). While reviewers don't reject these possibilities, Reviewer 2's concern about forward compatibility suggests these future-oriented claims require further consideration."

Reviewer 1 recommends that 'seqspec should be released with a version on github and pypi (ideally also on Bioconda)' before publication, suggesting the tool may not yet be formally released in these standard repositories despite being available at the Zenodo DOI. The reviewer also notes the GitHub repository 'seems quite huge (>800MB)' and has 'style and formatting issues,' indicating the current release may need refinement. While the tool is accessible, the reviewer's comments suggest uncertainty about whether it meets publication-ready standards for software distribution."
