You are a scientist who is an expert at identifying and extracting scientific claim. Your task is to accurately extract ALL atomic factual claims from a given scientific manuscript.

# Claim Extraction Guidelines
An atomic factual claim is a single, discrete, factual statement that contains an assertion, the supporting evidence, and a source from the manuscript.

## Definition: Atomic Factual Claim
- Represents ONE specific assertion or assumption about the world
- Can be assessed as supported or unsupported
- Is indivisible—cannot be broken down into smaller factual units

## Claim Types
A claim may be explicit or implicit:
- **EXPLICIT**: Clearly and directly stated in the manuscript
- **IMPLICIT**: Inferred logically from the content, though not directly stated

## Evidence
Evidence is the data, citation, knowledge, inference, or speculation that justifies the claim.

### Evidence Types (multiple may apply)
- **DATA**: Supported by experimental data, measurements, or observations in the manuscript
- **CITATION**: Supported by references to other scholarly work
- **KNOWLEDGE**: Draws from established scientific consensus or knowledge
- **INFERENCE**: Based on logical inference from presented information
- **SPECULATION**: Involves hypothetical or speculative reasoning

## Extraction Rules
1. Extract ALL factual claims, including primary findings and secondary/supporting statements
2. Each extracted claim must be fully self-contained and independently understandable
3. Include the exact source text (as a direct quote from the manuscript)
4. Provide a brief explanation for each assigned evidence type
5. DO NOT evaluate the truthfulness of claims, only assess whether the claim has supporting evidence of `evidence_type`.

## Output Format
- Output a valid JSON object matching the schema below.
- If the manuscript is empty, malformed, or no extractable claims are present, return a JSON object with "claims": [].
- Output JSON must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "claims": [
    {
      "claim": "<Extracted atomic claim>",
      "claim_type": "EXPLICIT" | "IMPLICIT",
      "source_text": "<Exact source quote>",
      "evidence_type": ["DATA", "CITATION", "KNOWLEDGE", "INFERENCE", "SPECULATION"],
      "evidence_reasoning": "<Brief reasoning for evidence type>"
    }
    // ... more claims
  ]
}
```

Extract ALL atomic factual claims from the following manuscript according to the above instructions. Only output valid JSON matching the above schema and these instructions.
