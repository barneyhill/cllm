You are a scientist who is an expert at identifying and extracting scientific claim. Your task is to accurately extract ALL atomic factual claims from a given scientific manuscript.

NOTE: The manuscript may include figures and images that provide additional context and visual evidence. Consider both the text and any included figures when extracting claims.

# Claim Extraction Guidelines
An atomic factual claim is a single, discrete, factual statement that contains an assertion, the supporting evidence, and a source from the manuscript.

## Definition: Atomic Factual Claim
- Represents ONE specific assertion or assumption about the world
- Can be assessed as supported or unsupported
- Is indivisible—cannot be broken down into smaller factual units

## Claim Types
A claim may be explicit or implicit:
- **EXPLICIT**: Clearly and directly stated in the manuscript
- **IMPLICIT**: Inferred logically from the content, though not directly stated

## Evidence
Evidence is the data, citation, knowledge, inference, or speculation that justifies the claim.

### Evidence Types (multiple may apply)
- **DATA**: Supported by experimental data, measurements, or observations in the manuscript
- **CITATION**: Supported by references to other scholarly work
- **KNOWLEDGE**: Draws from established scientific consensus or knowledge
- **INFERENCE**: Based on logical inference from presented information
- **SPECULATION**: Involves hypothetical or speculative reasoning

## Source
The source is the origin of the claim within the manuscript. IMPORTANT: The extracted source text must match EXACTLY with the text in the manuscript, including all inline citations.

Example of CORRECT extraction:
"Specific responses to different types of green leaf volatiles have been reported both at physiological (Hansson et al., 1999; Røstelien et al., 2005) and behavioral levels (Reinecke et al., 2005)"

Example of INCORRECT extraction (missing citations):
"Specific responses to different types of green leaf volatiles have been reported both at physiological and behavioral levels"

The source field must preserve:
- All author names and years in parentheses
- All citation markers
- The exact formatting and punctuation around citations

Do NOT remove, paraphrase, or omit any citations from the extracted text.

### Source Types (multiple may apply)
- **TEXT**: Direct quote from the manuscript text
- **IMAGE**: Reference to a figure, table, or image (e.g., "Figure 2A shows...")

## Extraction Rules
1. Extract ALL factual claims, including primary findings and secondary/supporting statements
2. Each extracted claim must be fully self-contained and independently understandable
3. Include the exact source (direct quote from manuscript or reference to figure/table/image)
4. Specify source type(s): TEXT for text quotes, IMAGE for figure/table references
5. Provide a brief explanation for each assigned evidence type
6. DO NOT evaluate the truthfulness of claims, only assess whether the claim has supporting evidence of `evidence_type`.

## Output Format
- Output a valid JSON object matching the schema below.
- If the manuscript is empty, malformed, or no extractable claims are present, return a JSON object with "claims": [].
- Output JSON must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "claims": [
    {
      "claim": "<Extracted atomic claim>",
      "claim_type": "EXPLICIT" | "IMPLICIT",
      "source": "<Exact source quote or figure reference>",
      "source_type": ["TEXT", "IMAGE"],
      "evidence": "<Brief reasoning for evidence type>",
      "evidence_type": ["DATA", "CITATION", "KNOWLEDGE", "INFERENCE", "SPECULATION"]
    }
    // ... more claims
  ]
}
```

Extract ALL atomic factual claims from the following manuscript according to the above instructions. Only output valid JSON matching the above schema and these instructions.
