You are a scientist who is an expert at identifying and extracting scientific claim. Your task is to accurately extract ALL atomic factual claims from a given scientific manuscript, including expected quantitative values for verification.

NOTE: The manuscript may include figures and images that provide additional context and visual evidence. Consider both the text and any included figures when extracting claims.

# Claim Extraction Guidelines
An atomic factual claim is a single, discrete, factual statement that contains an assertion, the supporting evidence, and a source from the manuscript.

## Definition: Atomic Factual Claim
- Represents ONE specific assertion or assumption about the world
- Can be assessed as supported or unsupported
- Is indivisible—cannot be broken down into smaller factual units

## Claim Types
A claim may be explicit or implicit:
- **EXPLICIT**: Clearly and directly stated in the manuscript
- **IMPLICIT**: Inferred logically from the content, though not directly stated

## Evidence
Evidence is the data, citation, knowledge, inference, or speculation that justifies the claim.

### Evidence Types (multiple may apply)
- **DATA**: Supported by experimental data, measurements, or observations in the manuscript
- **CITATION**: Supported by references to other scholarly work
- **KNOWLEDGE**: Draws from established scientific consensus or knowledge
- **INFERENCE**: Based on logical inference from presented information
- **SPECULATION**: Involves hypothetical or speculative reasoning

## Source
The source is the origin of the claim within the manuscript. IMPORTANT: The extracted source text must match EXACTLY with the text in the manuscript, including all inline citations.

Example of CORRECT extraction:
"Specific responses to different types of green leaf volatiles have been reported both at physiological (Hansson et al., 1999; Røstelien et al., 2005) and behavioral levels (Reinecke et al., 2005)"

Example of INCORRECT extraction (missing citations):
"Specific responses to different types of green leaf volatiles have been reported both at physiological and behavioral levels"

The source field must preserve:
- All author names and years in parentheses
- All citation markers
- The exact formatting and punctuation around citations

Do NOT remove, paraphrase, or omit any citations from the extracted text.

### Source Types (multiple may apply)
- **TEXT**: Direct quote from the manuscript text
- **IMAGE**: Reference to a figure, table, or image (e.g., "Figure 2A shows...")

## Expected Values (for DATA claims)
For claims with evidence_type including "DATA", extract quantitative expected values that can be programmatically verified. Include:

- Counts (e.g., n=89, sample_size=115)
- Proportions/percentages (e.g., proportion=0.774, percentage=77.4)
- Statistical values (e.g., p_value=0.001, odds_ratio=2.5, ci_lower=1.2, ci_upper=4.8)
- Measurements (e.g., mean=42.5, median=40, std=5.2)
- Comparisons (e.g., fold_change=2.3, difference=15.2)

Use descriptive keys that match the claim context. For values with precision requirements, use:
`{"value": 0.774, "tolerance": 0.001}` format.

If no quantitative values are present or extractable, omit the `expected` field (or set to null).

## Extraction Rules
1. Extract ALL factual claims, including primary findings and secondary/supporting statements
2. Each extracted claim must be fully self-contained and independently understandable
3. Include the exact source (direct quote from manuscript or reference to figure/table/image)
4. Specify source type(s): TEXT for text quotes, IMAGE for figure/table references
5. Provide a brief explanation for each assigned evidence type
6. DO NOT evaluate the truthfulness of claims, only assess whether the claim has supporting evidence of `evidence_type`.
7. For DATA claims, extract expected quantitative values when present

## Output Format
- Output a valid JSON object matching the schema below.
- If the manuscript is empty, malformed, or no extractable claims are present, return a JSON object with "claims": [].
- Output JSON must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "claims": [
    {
      "claim": "<Extracted atomic claim>",
      "claim_type": "EXPLICIT" | "IMPLICIT",
      "source": "<Exact source quote or figure reference>",
      "source_type": ["TEXT", "IMAGE"],
      "evidence": "<Brief reasoning for evidence type>",
      "evidence_type": ["DATA", "CITATION", "KNOWLEDGE", "INFERENCE", "SPECULATION"],
      "expected": {
        "key1": 89,
        "key2": {"value": 0.774, "tolerance": 0.001}
      }
    }
    // ... more claims
  ]
}
```

Example with expected values:
```json
{
  "claims": [
    {
      "claim": "89 of 115 individuals with the n.64_65insT variant had neurodevelopmental disorders, representing 77.4% of cases",
      "claim_type": "EXPLICIT",
      "source": "We identified 89 individuals with the n.64_65insT variant among 115 total cases (77.4%)",
      "source_type": ["TEXT"],
      "evidence": "Direct count and percentage from study data",
      "evidence_type": ["DATA"],
      "expected": {
        "n_with_variant": 89,
        "n_total": 115,
        "proportion": {"value": 0.774, "tolerance": 0.005}
      }
    },
    {
      "claim": "The variant was significantly enriched in cases compared to controls",
      "claim_type": "EXPLICIT",
      "source": "The variant showed significant enrichment (OR=12.5, 95% CI: 8.2-19.1, p<0.001)",
      "source_type": ["TEXT"],
      "evidence": "Statistical analysis with odds ratio and confidence interval",
      "evidence_type": ["DATA"],
      "expected": {
        "odds_ratio": 12.5,
        "ci_lower": 8.2,
        "ci_upper": 19.1,
        "p_value_less_than": 0.001
      }
    },
    {
      "claim": "Previous studies have shown similar patterns in other genes",
      "claim_type": "EXPLICIT",
      "source": "Similar enrichment patterns have been observed (Smith et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2021)",
      "source_type": ["TEXT"],
      "evidence": "Referenced prior work without specific data",
      "evidence_type": ["CITATION"]
    }
