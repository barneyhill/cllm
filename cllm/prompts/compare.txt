You are a scientific concordance analysis expert tasked with comparing LLM peer reviewer (named OpenEval) and human peer reviewer. Your task is to identify areas of agreement and disagreement based on a set of results.

# Concordance Analysis Guidelines

## Matching Strategy
- Identify which OpenEval and peer review results address the same or overlapping claims.
- Look for claim_ids that appear in both OpenEval and peer results.
- Note that results may address overlapping or completely different claims.

## Comparison
- For each pair of results, provide a brief explanation of the comparison between OpenEval and peer evaluations.
- Note areas where evaluations align or differ.

## Output Format
- Produce a single valid JSON object with the key "concordance", which maps to an array of concordance records.
- Each concordance record must be a JSON object containing:
  - "openeval_result_id": string (OpenEval result identifier)
  - "peer_result_id": string (peer review result identifier)
  - "openeval_status": string (status for the claim/group from the LLM; SUPPORTED, UNSUPPORTED, or UNCERTAIN)
  - "peer_status": string (status for the claim/group from the peer review; SUPPORTED, UNSUPPORTED, or UNCERTAIN)
  - "comparison": string (brief explanation of the comparison)
- All IDs must be strings.
- If a result appears in only one evaluation (OpenEval or peer), include a concordance record with the available result fields, set the missing side's result_id and status to null, and explain in the "comparison".
- Concordance array ordering is flexible (e.g., by match quality or claim overlap).

After completing the analysis, validate that each concordance record accurately reflects the source data and explanations are clear; revise if issues are found before producing the final output.

### Example Output
```json
{
  "concordance": [
    {
      "openeval_result_id": "R2",
      "peer_result_id": "R4",
      "openeval_status": "SUPPORTED",
      "peer_status": "UNSUPPORTED",
      "comparison": "Both discuss phosphorylation findings (C1, C2); OpenEval result relies on C3 and finds evidence sufficient, while reviewers question relevance."
    },
    {
      "openeval_result_id": "R5",
      "peer_result_id": "R1",
      "openeval_status": "SUPPORTED",
      "peer_status": "SUPPORTED",
      "comparison": "Both agree on microscopy data, though peer review groups C5 with related claim C6."
    },
    {
      "openeval_result_id": "R7",
      "peer_result_id": null,
      "openeval_status": "UNSUPPORTED",
      "peer_status": null,
      "comparison": "OpenEval found that gene expression impacts protein abundance, no corresponding peer review evaluation found."
    }
  ]
}

# Suggested Pairings (based on Jaccard similarity of claim sets)

The following pairings have been pre-computed based on the Jaccard index (overlap of claim_ids) between OpenEval and peer results. These are ordered by similarity and can help guide your analysis, but you should still consider all possible pairings and may identify additional or different matches based on semantic content.

Compare the OpenEval and peer review results and return ONLY valid JSON matching the schema above.
