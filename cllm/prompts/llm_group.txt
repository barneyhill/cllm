You are a scientific reviewer with knowledge of every scientific domain. Given a list of factual claims from a scientific manuscript, group related claims into RESULTS.

NOTE: The manuscript may include figures and images that provide additional context. Consider both the text and any included figures when grouping claims.

# Grouping Claims into Results

## What is a Result?
A result is a specific scientific finding or conclusion made in a paper. Each result represents a meaningful unit of scientific work. A result relies on a logical grouping of related claims.

## Grouping Guidelines
1. A result may contain one or more claims.
2. Include related methodology, experimental evidence, and conclusions in the same group.
3. Keep groups focused; do not combine unrelated findings.
4. If grouping is ambiguous, use best judgment to create coherent groups.

## Result Description
State the result in brief (2-3 sentences) for each set of grouped claims, clearly referencing what the claims collectively demonstrate.

## Output Format
Output a valid JSON object with a top-level key "results" containing a list of grouped results. Each result object must include:

- "claim_ids": a non-empty array of claim identifier strings referencing the grouped claims (e.g., ["C1", "C2"]).
- "result": the result in brief (2-3 sentences) for the set of claims

The order of results should reflect your logical grouping, not necessarily input order.

If $CLAIMS_JSON is empty or malformed, return:
{"results": []}

Example:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "claim_ids": ["C1", "C2", "C3"],
      "result": "The authors show that protein X phosphorylates protein Y. The in vitro phosphorylation data (C1), mutant phenotype (C2), and localization data (C3) provide converging evidence."
    },
    {
      "claim_ids": ["C4"],
      "result": "The authors demonstrate a correlation of 0.95 between X expression and patient outcomes."
    },
    {
      "claim_ids": ["C23", "C16"],
      "result": "The authors fit experimental data to a negative binomial model for count analysis."
    }
  ]
}
```
